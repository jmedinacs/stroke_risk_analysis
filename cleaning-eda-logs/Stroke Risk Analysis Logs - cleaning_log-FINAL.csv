10,4/16/2025,Binned age into medical stroke study category.,"Separated age into categories: pediatric (<18), young adult (<40), middle aged adult (<60), senior (<80), and elderly (80+).",Create a numeric helper column to enable proper sorting of age groups in ascending order.,completed
11,4/16/2025,Added age helper column.,Assigned numeric values to each age group for sorting: 1 (pediatric) to 5 (elderly).,None,completed
12,4/16/2025,Replaced N/A bmi values with median value.,Used the calculated median BMI value of 28.1 from the continuous_data_evaluation sheet to replace missing values.

14,4/16/2025,Check for outliers in continuous data.,"Used the IQR method to identify outliers in avg_glucose_level and bmi. While upper-bound outliers were found, they reflect rare but plausible medical conditions and were retained.",Consider binning high glucose and BMI values for better interpretation.,completed
15,4/16/2025,Bmi helper column added.,Assigned numeric values to each bmi category for sorting: 1 (underweight) to 4 (obese).,"Consider the possibility of splitting obese into obese 1, obese 2, and obese 3 categories.",completed
16,4/17/2025,Bin average glucose level into medical standard.,"* Since there is no indication if the glucose levels in the dataset are fasting, random, or non-fasting, we will make an assumption of fasting and categorize the data this way.
* Based on WHO , CDC, and ADA standards, the categories are hypoglycemic (<70), normal (<100), prediabetes (<125), and diabetes (>- 125).",Further study the data distribution and consider if a different categorization may be necessary.,completed
