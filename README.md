# Stroke Risk Analysis

## Business Task

The goal of this analysis is to **identify the top three risk factors associated with having a stroke** using the [Stroke Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset). This insight is essential for developing targeted prevention strategies and raising awareness for high-risk populations.

## Key Questions

- What demographic or health-related features are most associated with stroke occurrence?
- Are there combinations of risk factors that appear together?
- How can data-driven insights guide preventative health measures?

## Data Source

- Dataset: [Kaggle - Stroke Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset) by fedesoriano  
- Size: 5,110 records  
- Features include: age, BMI, glucose level, hypertension, heart disease, work type, and more.

## Process Overview

This project follows a structured data analysis pipeline:
1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Standardized missing values  
   - Categorized continuous variables (age, glucose, BMI) using industry norms  
   - Standardized all categorical values to lowercase with spaces  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**  
   - Distribution of stroke vs. non-stroke across demographic and health features  
   - Chi-square tests to assess feature importance for categorical variables  
3. **Insights and Recommendations**  
   - Identification of top 3 stroke risk factors  
   - Practical recommendations for public health stakeholders

## Findings

The analysis revealed that the **three most prominent stroke risk factors** are:



## Recommendations

Based on the findings, we propose the following recommendations:
